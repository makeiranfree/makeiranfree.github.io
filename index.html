                        <p>The current wave of protests in Iran began in late December 2025 amid a severe economic collapse. A sharp devaluation of the national currency, runaway inflation, and the rising cost of basic goods pushed many people past a breaking point. Initial actions included strikes and shop closures—most notably in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar—followed by street demonstrations in multiple cities. Early demands focused on economic survival, corruption, and government mismanagement, reflecting widespread frustration with daily living conditions rather than an explicitly ideological agenda.

                        <p>However, as protests spread across the whole country and the state responded with immediate and extreme violence, the movement rapidly transformed into an openly anti-regime uprising. Protesters began chanting slogans rejecting the Islamic Republic in its entirety, calling not for reform but for the end of the system itself. According to live reporting and human-rights documentation, the scale of repression—live ammunition, mass arrests, killings, and intimidation of families—eliminated any remaining belief that meaningful change could occur within the existing political structure. The regime’s response reinforced a widely held conclusion among protesters: the violence is not a policy failure but a feature of the system.

                        <p>Iranians have long experienced state violence, systemic human rights violations, and oppression. Over the decades, the regime has systematically silenced political opposition, suppressed freedom of speech, and cracked down on protests with force. Ethnic minorities and dissidents, particularly the Baha’is and Kurds, have borne the brunt of this repression. The regime’s use of torture, forced confessions, and public executions has cultivated deep distrust in any possibility for reform. These ongoing abuses created an environment where economic struggles were seen as part of a larger, more ingrained pattern of oppression, making it clear to many Iranians that protesting against the regime was the only viable option.

                        <p>This shift is not unprecedented. Large-scale protests under the Islamic Republic—most notably in 2009, 2017–2019, and 2022’s Woman, Life, Freedom uprising—have repeatedly followed the same trajectory: initial grievances escalate into systemic rejection after violent crackdowns. Each cycle has left deeper mistrust and fewer illusions about reform.

                        <p>Iran’s security forces have responded to the nationwide protests with lethal force on a scale that international observers describe as among the most severe since the 1979 revolution, while the true death toll remains obscured by communication blackouts and systematic information suppression. Verified counts compiled by the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) and reported by outlets such as the Associated Press place confirmed deaths in the several-thousand range, establishing a conservative lower bound based on documented cases. However, multiple credible sources warn that these figures capture only a fraction of the violence. CBS News, citing sources inside Iran and corroborated visual evidence, has reported that at least 12,000 people may have been killed, with the possibility that the number could reach or exceed 20,000, particularly during the period of the nationwide internet shutdown. CBS also verified video showing hundreds of bodies at a Tehran-area morgue, many bearing gunshot wounds, shotgun “birdshot,” and signs of severe trauma, consistent with large-scale use of lethal force. In parallel, TIME has reported analytical estimates based on hospital data and eyewitness footage suggesting deaths in the high thousands, while emphasizing that no precise tally is currently possible. Most significantly, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran has warned that information from medical professionals and civil society sources indicates the death toll may surpass 20,000, underscoring both the magnitude of the crackdown and the extent to which censorship has prevented independent verification of its full human cost.</p>

                        <p>Alongside the use of lethal force, Iranian authorities have carried out mass arbitrary arrests on an unprecedented scale, signaling an escalation from street repression to judicial terror. Reuters and Associated Press report that more than 10,000–18,000 people have been detained nationwide since the protests began, including demonstrators, journalists, lawyers, students, and bystanders. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch document widespread violations during arrests, including beatings, incommunicado detention, denial of legal counsel, and coerced confessions. At the same time, senior judicial officials have publicly called for fast-track trials and severe punishments, explicitly invoking capital charges such as “moharebeh” (“waging war against God”) and “corruption on earth”—offenses historically used to justify executions of political opponents. International alarm has intensified following reports from Reuters, Time, and The Guardian that detainees face imminent execution after summary proceedings, with rights groups warning that the judiciary is being weaponized to instill fear and deter further protests. High-profile cases, such as that of Erfan Soltani, illustrate the real and immediate danger facing thousands of detainees, as international observers and the UN human-rights office warn that Iran is poised to repeat—and possibly exceed—the execution campaigns seen during past protest crackdowns.</p>

                        <p>In response to the escalating protests, the Iranian government cut off internet access nationwide on 8 January 2026, marking a severe escalation in the regime's use of digital suppression. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have highlighted this internet shutdown as a deliberate attempt to hide human-rights violations from both domestic and international audiences. The shutdown effectively disconnected the country from the outside world, restricting the ability of Iranians to share information, organize protests, or document abuses in real time. This has left global observers unable to verify casualty figures or the full scope of the state’s violence, significantly impeding the flow of crucial information.</p>
                        <p>Despite these efforts, SpaceX’s Starlink has provided a lifeline, allowing activists and protesters to continue sharing footage of the crackdown. However, Iranian authorities have made efforts to jam these satellite signals, demonstrating how critical the regime views control over the digital landscape. As reported by AP News, this technological cat-and-mouse game underscores the regime's growing reliance on information suppression as a tool to control the narrative.</p>
                        <p>Al Jazeera and Reuters further emphasize that the regime has already signaled its intention to maintain the blackout as long as necessary to suppress further unrest, thereby solidifying internet restrictions as a central feature of the state’s response to public opposition. This targeted information suppression ensures that, despite widespread protests, the narrative about the crackdown remains controlled by the Iranian government.</p>

                        <p>What is happening in Iran is not an abstract political dispute or a regional power struggle. It is a direct assault on basic human rights: the right to life, the right to protest peacefully, the right to due process, and the right to communicate with the outside world. People are being killed for demonstrating, arrested without charges, denied lawyers, and threatened with execution after summary trials. These are not controversial values or cultural differences — they are the minimum standards of human dignity recognized under international law.</p>
                        <p>Reducing the situation to “internal politics” misses the point. When a state uses live ammunition against civilians, cuts off the internet to hide evidence, and weaponizes courts to terrorize society, the issue stops being domestic. It becomes a human-rights crisis. Ignoring it does not make it more complex or nuanced — it simply allows the violations to continue without consequence.</p>

                <h3>Silence Does Not Mean Neutrality — It Helps the Oppressor</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Silence is not neutral in the face of repression.</li>
                    <li>Lack of attention enables further violence.</li>
                    <li>Visibility is one of the few protections available to civilians.</li>
                </ul>

                        <p>In situations like this, silence is often framed as neutrality or caution. In reality, it functions as permission. Authoritarian systems rely on the assumption that the world will look away once the headlines fade. When governments, institutions, and the public stay quiet, it signals to those in power that there will be no cost for escalating violence.</p>
                        <p>Inside Iran, this dynamic is well understood. Protesters repeatedly risk their lives to get footage out precisely because they know that visibility is protection. When attention drops, repression increases. Silence does not protect civilians — it isolates them. It tells the state that there are no witnesses left who matter.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The regime is downplaying the numbers of civilians who have been killed. They are saying 2,000 - but the numbers are at least 12,000 and growing.</li>
                    <li>The regime is saying that Mossad agents are the ones killing protestors. The regime is trying to appropriate the dead, by calling for a national day of mourning.</li>
                    <li>The regime claims this uprising is foreign-driven and because of sanctions that have caused the economy to fail. This is just not true.</li>
                    <li>The Center for Human Rights in Iran and the Iranian Diaspora Collective (IDC) are great sources.  IDC has a resource for journalists covering Iran, with verified, credible sources rather than regime-linked narratives.</li>
