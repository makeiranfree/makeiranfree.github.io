                <h2>What’s happening in Iran</h2>
                <p>— Protests began in December 2025 due to economic hardship: currency collapse, inflation, and rising costs.</p>
                <p>— Protesters are calling for the complete collapse of the Islamic Republic, reflecting decades of repression, broken promises, and impunity.</p>
                <p>— Nationwide spread of protests, with significant participation across over 50 cities, fueled by the regime’s violent response.</p>

                        <p>The current wave of protests in Iran began in late December 2025 amid a severe economic collapse. A sharp devaluation of the national currency, runaway inflation, and the rising cost of basic goods pushed many people past a breaking point. Initial actions included strikes and shop closures—most notably in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar—followed by street demonstrations in multiple cities. Early demands focused on economic survival, corruption, and government mismanagement, reflecting widespread frustration with daily living conditions rather than an explicitly ideological agenda.

                        <p>However, as protests spread across the whole country and the state responded with immediate and extreme violence, the movement rapidly transformed into an openly anti-regime uprising. Protesters began chanting slogans rejecting the Islamic Republic in its entirety, calling not for reform but for the end of the system itself. According to live reporting and human-rights documentation, the scale of repression—live ammunition, mass arrests, killings, and intimidation of families—eliminated any remaining belief that meaningful change could occur within the existing political structure. The regime’s response reinforced a widely held conclusion among protesters: the violence is not a policy failure but a feature of the system.

                        <p>Iranians have long experienced state violence, systemic human rights violations, and oppression. Over the decades, the regime has systematically silenced political opposition, suppressed freedom of speech, and cracked down on protests with force. Ethnic minorities and dissidents, particularly the Baha’is and Kurds, have borne the brunt of this repression. The regime’s use of torture, forced confessions, and public executions has cultivated deep distrust in any possibility for reform. These ongoing abuses created an environment where economic struggles were seen as part of a larger, more ingrained pattern of oppression, making it clear to many Iranians that protesting against the regime was the only viable option.
[Human Rights Watch; UN Special Rapporteur Reports; Center for Human Rights in Iran]</p>
                        <p>This shift is not unprecedented. Large-scale protests under the Islamic Republic—most notably in 2009, 2017–2019, and 2022’s Woman, Life, Freedom uprising—have repeatedly followed the same trajectory: initial grievances escalate into systemic rejection after violent crackdowns. Each cycle has left deeper mistrust and fewer illusions about reform.
